**Job Title**

Guten Tag Zelfi:

My friend and one of your developers, Luca Antonacci, told me good things about your company and after looking at your website's job openings I would like to submit my resume for the [JEE und PHP Backend Entwickler](http://www.zelfi.com/jobs/jee-und-php-backend-entwickler/) position.

I have been a permanent resident of Mainz for the past year now and am searching within Mainz and the surrounding area for a more challenging position as a developer. Currently, I am leading a project here in Rüsselsheim working with local as well as distributed developers to deploy mobile in-vehicle apps for Opel/General Motors.

While my experience has mainly consisted of front end web/mobile developement I have also worked for Volkswagen transforming their inventory web services (PHP/Slim) to produce leaner mobile optimized services. The prospect of also becoming versed in iOS/Android is also an area where I have a great amount of interest and would like to become an expert in these areas as well.

Please feel free to contact me and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Grüße/Best,
