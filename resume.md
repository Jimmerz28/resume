## Experience

### CW Professional Services (March 2014 – Present)

#### General Motors Infotainment

On assignment at Opel HQ in Rüsselsheim Germany acting as the Technical Lead for all Infotainment related projects in Europe. 

Leading a team of on site and remote developers to produce in vehicle applications

### Compuware Corporation (September 2011 – March 2014)

#### Volkswagen

Transformed existing webservices by creating middleware using PHP (Slim) as existing services were too heavy for mobile app consumption. 

The project was driven with TDD and automated build deployments to ensure test passed and Sonar scans were within tolerable limits.

#### General Motors

Took an existing SharePoint site which was optimized only for desktop usage and revamped the entire architecture, design and user interaction in order to fit mobile platforms. 

This required testing across multiple devices to ensure consistent quality across mobile browsers as support for HMTL5/CSS3 was fractured at the time.
